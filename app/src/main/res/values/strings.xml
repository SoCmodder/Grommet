&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Rock the Vote is committed to preserving your privacy and safeguarding your
sensitive information. The following statement describes the general information-gathering and
usage practices of the online voter registration platform powered by Rock the Vote.
</p>
<ol >
<li>All personal information and other unique identifiers submitted in the process of registering
to vote are used to produce the voter registration form for you to send to your local or state
election officials. If you provide a state-issued identification number or Social Security number,
it will be used solely for the production of your voter registration form.
</li>
<li>Once you mail in or electronically submit your voter registration application form to your
local or state election officials, it becomes a matter of public record and is available for
inspection and use by those who satisfy the requirements of the State law governing its use.
</li>
<li>By using the online voter registration platform, you grant Rock the Vote and its online voter
registration partners permission to use your personal contact information to send you
communications. Rock the Vote is bound by its
<a href="https://www.rockthevote.com/about-us/privacy-policy.html">privacy policy</a>.
All entities using the Rock the Vote online voter registration tool are bound to act in accordance
with their privacy policies. You can unsubscribe at any time by following the unsubscribe
instructions on the communication itself.
</li>
<li>Rock the Vote may track information on where its online voter registration platform is being
visited and used so we can make decisions about the design and usage of the online voter
registration tool.
</li>
<li>Whenever Rock the Vote handles information that you enter on the online voter registration
platform, regardless of where this occurs, we take steps to ensure that your information is treated
securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the
Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal
information, Rock the Vote cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to
us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to
ensure its security on our systems.
